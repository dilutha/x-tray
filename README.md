# Pneumonia Detection with Chest X-rays

This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using machine learning models.

## Overview

The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the Chest X-ray images (Pneumonia) dataset to classify X-ray images into pneumonia and non-pneumonia classes. The model is deployed using Streamlit for interactive web-based inference.
